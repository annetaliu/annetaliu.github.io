My intention to study on this aspect is a wish to have a robot with homor , like the robots in Star Trek.

**What is computational linguistics?**

"
Computational linguistics is the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. 
Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena.
 These models may be "knowledge-based" ("hand-crafted") or "data-driven" ("statistical" or "empirical"). 
 Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; 
 and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. 
 Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, 
 including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few.
